##  ✈️ Flights Case Study

In this casestudy, we will be exploring a dataset containing information about flights, including their departure and arrival times, airports, airlines, and more.
By the end of this analysis, we will have a better understanding of the flights dataset and the insights that can be derived from it using SQL. 
This knowledge can be used to make data-driven decisions and to inform future analyses.

This casestudy focuses more on the use of DATETIME Functions available in MYSQL.
