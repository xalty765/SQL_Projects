###  Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?

There are two ways to solve this 
1) we can take count of the table individually 
2)  or we can fetch the names from information schema and sum the table row to get the count

Approach 1: 
````sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    director_mapping;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    genre;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    movie;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    ratings;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    role_mapping;
````
Appraoch 2:
````sql
SELECT 
    table_name, SUM(table_rows) AS total_rows
FROM
    information_schema.Tables
WHERE
    table_schema = 'imdb'
GROUP BY table_name;
